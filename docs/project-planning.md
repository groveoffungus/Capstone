# Capstone Project Planning - Week 1

## Definition Statement
I want to build an application that can be used by Archeologists/Cultural Investigators for storing relative project data points.

## Audience
Archeologists and Cultural Investigators working with specific data points within field projects.


## Application Content
  - Main Page
    - Select a project to work on
  - About Page
    - Explain what the application is and contact information
    - Have application user instructions
  - Admin Page
    - List current project for editing and deletion
    - Create a new project
  - Project Page
    - List project data points
    - Edit, delete, map current data points
    - Create a new data point

  - The purpose of my application is to provide a way to keep track of cultural data points within projects

  - This will solve the issues with lost data point information and locations

  - Attributes of your website
    - Colors palette will include white, lightgreen, and light blue
    - Images will be satellite imagery obtained through an API
    - Fonts will be standard type and easily readable, and black in color
    - Maybe a logo
    - A navigation bar will be on the top of ever page

  - All the sites I looked at contained a lot of information on the subject matter. Their services were very complete.
  - The application already available were very complex, expensive, and designed for large entities.
  - My application will be for smaller entities who want to self-host the data.
